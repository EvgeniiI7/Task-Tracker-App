# Taskinator-Task-Tracker-App

## That is a front-end project.

``` 
Taskinator will allow you to organize your personal to-do list items
 by using a dropdown menu to change the task status and 
 move the task into "To Do", "In Progress", and "Completed lists".
``` 
Build with: 
. JS
. HTMl
. CSS


* Access the DOM using methods ```addEventListener()```, ```querySelector()``` , ```createElement()``` , ``` setAttribute```, ```and getAttribute()``` .
* Added interactivity with HTML by adding browser event listeners such as ```click``` , ```submit``` , and ```change``` 
* Handle events in JavaScript using callback functions. 
* Used the ```event ``` object.
* Used the DOM to both read content from the HTML page and create new content to add to or edit on the page.
* Identify DOM elements using HTML5 data attributes so that we can interact with them.
* Store task items in an organized list using an array of objects.
* Sync the data with the display in the browser.
* Save data using ``` localStorage``` , and serialize and de-serialize the data using ``` JSON.stringify()```  and ```JSON.parse()```.
* Tracked technical debt and refactor the code as needed.
